Hi there! In this video, we'll be building a simple chat application using Express.js.
You'll learn the basics of WebSockets, handling connections, and more.

Before we dive into creating this chat masterpiece, please make sure you have 
the following packages installed:

WebSockets: npm install ws
HTTP: npm install http
Note: This application is not secure. Anyone with access to the URL will be able to see all messages sent to the server.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask in the comments!
